# Lab 1 - Project proposal 

## expressing emotions Plants

### Give a short narrative list detailing your objectives
You can see. Many people have plants in their homes. We also have a lot of plants at home. We have at least ten plants on our balcony. And each plant has its weather preferences and different levels of water deficiency. But you know that we don't know what his water deficiency is.

### Tell us the story of why you are doing what you are doing
So it occurred to me that if the plant could show its emotions through the planter, it would make it clear to the user what it needs. But, of course, this would require an Arduino to make an intelligent planter that senses the plant's needs and makes the corresponding emotions.
For example, when there is a lack of water, it appears with a depressed mood sound and a tilted trellis. I then know it is short of water. Therefore, I need to water it.
Like sensing that it's raining outside and the plant will feel excited! It will make exciting noises and shake the vase.
All of this is fun. It adds interest to life and solves the problem of people not knowing how to look after their plants.

### What inspired you? 
The idea was inspired by an argument I had with my mother about watering the flowers. We both had different ideas on how often to water the plants. That's when I thought, "If only the plants could tell me that they are short of water," and came up with this idea.

### What are the future possibilities for this project?
I think this idea is also necessary for the current environment. Nowadays, many people keep plants, but they also don't get to know the preferences of the plants and how to rinse them. They think it's beautiful to have plants in the room or on the balcony. Rarely do they pay attention to the plants? My smart device is designed to inspire people to pay more attention to the plant itself and think about its own emotions and life. People don't just need to pay attention to the beauty of the plant, but also the plant's life. After all, not taking good care of a plant can also harm a quiet life.
