# Part 2: Creative Labs

Imagine a speculative scifi machine using only the parts from today's labs. For inspiration, remember most of the interfaces on StarTrek are just LEDs and buttons. Have fun with it! Make up something you think would be an interface for the future using just the skils we learned from the readings and the labs. What affordances with a future interface considers? Who would it serve? What would it be indicating or doing? When you are done, upload your project to your project log website.
