# Reflection Exercise

### Reflect on creating interfaces for your body. Consider how we engage with tools â€“ how does this impact how your body extends into the tools around you? What possibilities do you see?



We see the possibility of body enhancement or replacement. That is, post-human. Since the beginning of the total industrial revolution, we have gradually discovered that, especially the steam engine's invention. The relationship between human beings and tools has become increasingly close. At first, it was mechanical circuits that were involved in the production of our goods. Then it became involved in our daily lives. Then it became computers that influenced our thinking and got us hooked. Now the sensory parts of tools are "creeping" into our bodies, for example, sensing our health, blood oxygen, heart rate.

It is easy to imagine that in the future, tools will invade our bodies more and more. We will use tools to enhance our body functions, extend the human life span, etc. However, we will not go into these possibilities as they are apparent.

However, I do think that our eventual deepening with tools will affect class solidification even more. The wealthy upper classes will use tools to enhance their bodies and track their health in real-time. The tools enhance their longevity and energy. The middle class will use tools to speed up their efficiency, which will change this class into faster and more intelligent tools. The lower class will use tools to enjoy and develop violence. The influence of our bodies and tools will gradually take control and reverse the influence of our class. These are the possibilities I see.
