### Reflect: How did building the hand vary between the first version with the sensors on your fingers to the second from the first one with the sensors on the puppet hand? In what ways did you feel your cognition slip between the hand and the puppet. Did this puppet ever become ready to hand?


I think the most significant difference is that hand perception is now synchronised. Previously, hand perception was in tunes with reality, such as moving one's fingers and touching an object to trigger a sound effect or light. But this puppet gave me an extraordinary feeling. He made me feel like my hand was pulling the sound. Yet, at the same time, the puppet moved.

But I didn't get the feeling that the puppet could become a natural hand. I think this is because the thumbs are very difficult to manipulate. If we had fixed this problem, it would have made the puppet controls feel very realistic to me.
